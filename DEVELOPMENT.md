## Summary

**log.c3** is a learning project to learn and understand C3 and the way it works, but also to improve my own knowledge.

It's by all means not perfect, but that's the design choice. It was created to be minimalistic and simple to use.

## Roadmap

I would love to improve on **log.c3** and one of them is to allow it to make logging to file efficiently.

## Known Issues

None as of yet.
